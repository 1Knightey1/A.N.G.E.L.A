Support of custom race of your choice can be asked in special Discussion.\nBeside graphical changes she has various dialogues, including a few new ones, and a \"lore\" item!\n\nYou can add and remove the mod at any progress and it shouldn't break your saves (but for security reasons back up your saves and write us if something is wrong).\n\nIt works fine in Multiplayer (your friends won't see Angela and her messages if they don't have her) but you may have some problems with connection, so beware.\n\nIf you use Frackin' Universe, we recommend you subscribing to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2795539792]a special[/url], FU version of this mod\n\n[img]https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/615873894045188137/965037984053358633/Mod_desription_image2.png[/img]\n\nNew lua files for this mod were done by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/patmanf/]patman[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoistCrevace/]Nebulox[/url].
